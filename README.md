# Statipy
### Intended purpose/function
#### Parses Spotify Data Packages locally (offline) using just the code in this repo.
The Data Package is obtained by requesting it from the bottom of your [Spotify Account Privacy page](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/).
You will receive a zip by email.  
Place the zip in the same directory as `main.py` for it to be read from.  

**There seems to exist many similar tools tho... so why?**  
Most of these tools are online with feature restrictions; 
you cannot see certain statistics unless you pay.
That's lame, and you could be skeptical about what they do with your data.
Offline analysis with open source programs like this provides the maximum privacy :)  
  
**Ok, but i think there are other projects with the exact same purpose...**  
yeah well ok allow it, im just bored  
go use theirs its prolly better

### desc
name is a mashup of "Statistics for Spotify in Python"  

I will gradually add features... whenever I feel like it... could take years... or centuries...  

for now, run `main.py` to well... run it!
